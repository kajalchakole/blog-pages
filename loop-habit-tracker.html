        <p>Habits!! <br>

            What comes to our minds when we say this word?? Hmm... surely there's a long list of habits with everyone of
            us which we want to inculcate in our daily life. Today I'm going to talk about one of the most important app
            which I discovered last year while I was willing to track down my habits. Yes, you got it right. We keep on
            procrastinating for those exercise sessions, journal writing, waking up early, meditation and all sorts of
            activities and then it takes us on a guilt trip every now and then.</p>
        <p>I also wanted to track down these habits. But along with the tracking part, I was more worried about the
            reminders, the analysis of my daily progress on each of these habits. And while going through enormous apps
            on Play Store, I found Loops Habit Tracker.</p>
        <p><strong>About Loop Habit Tracker</strong></p>
        <p>So this app won't look fancy at first sight, but trust me this is something we all need to start with for our
            habit tracking. This one app is packed with Graphs, statistics, scores, reminders and all those features you
            need to keep a check on your habits but at the same time it has its ease of use and simplicity maintained.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Best Features</strong></p>
        <p>Next offers best customization according to your locations like Work, Home, On the go.</p>
        <p>The best feature for beginners is the Reminders which you can set for each of your habits. These reminders
            can be set for any day, hour or on weekly basis. Whatever combination you want, you can set it as per your
            convenience. Also, to those who are coping up with their procrastination, can snooze the reminder too.</p>
        <p>Not just apps but the wallpapers can be also set as per these modes. So it will set your favorite
            wallpaper for you when you are working or relaxing at home.</p>
        <p><strong>Widgets: </strong>For me, the best part was the simple widgets which I could place on my home screen
            directly for each of my daily habits. Once, you complete the task you can just tap the widget and it ticks
            the habit in the app.</p>
        <p><strong>Graphs: </strong>Once you start to get into the habit cycle, it will also show you details of the tasks done, when you missed it, how is the streak going on, that too separately on each habit you place in the app.</p>

        <p><strong>Night Mode: </strong>For those of us who loves to reflect each night on the tasks done, can use night mode to prevent your eyes from straining.</p>
        <p><strong>Ad Free: </strong>There's a good news!! Nowadays, as ads and data collection is the new norm, this app won't annoy you with unnecessary ads, while you are checking your score. The app can be used completely offline without breaching your privacy. And you can export your data and do whatever you want to do with it. I am sure after getting aligned with your habits you would want to publish it somewhere on your Instagram or Facebook accounts.</p>
