        <p>I have been searching for a highly customized Screen Locker that would suite my needs since a long time
            for my Android device. I did not want a lock screen to have a random static photos on it and which is only
            good for unlocking my phone. I always wanted to have a lock screen which would provide me access to all my
            notifications without unlocking the screen. Also sometimes get rid of them right away by a simple swipe.</p>
        <p>Few months back, was going through Google Play apps and I came across this name called “Next”. Didn’t get
            much idea about the app from its name though. But the developer name made me curious to download it. Just to
            let you all know, it is offered by Microsoft Corporation, a big name of course. It’s a product from
            “Microsoft Garage” team who have a very small list of apps as of now but they have really useful stuff out
            there.</p>
        <p><strong>About Next</strong></p>
        <p>Next is not just a simple lock screen which users think they would use to just unlock their phones. Trust me,
            this app will give you lot of cool features packed in one Apk starting from all your Calendar
            Events, Emails, SMS, Whatsapp, Viber, Hangout, Weather and many other mostly used apps today.</p>
        <p><strong>Best Features</strong></p>
        <p>Next offers best customization according to your locations like Work, Home, On the go.</p>
        <p>Yes, you can set all your apps that you frequently need in a small drawer at the bottom of your
            lock screen when you are at work, home or on the go. It will automatically detect you location and
            show a separate set of apps you have saved for that location on your lock screen. With either a single
            or a double tap, you can launch your favorite app or toggle your settings like Wifi, Data, Bluetooth, Torch
            etc right from your lock screen. Control your music on apps like Spotify, Audible, and Pandora without
            actually getting into the player.</p>
        <p>Not just apps but the wallpapers can be also set as per these modes. So it will set your favorite
            wallpaper for you when you are working or relaxing at home.</p>
        <p>Another icing on the cake for me was the <strong>daily Bing wallpaper</strong>. If some day you are out of
            stock for the wallpapers this feature will bring altogether new wallpapers on your lock screen every day
            that too from Bing. What more you can think of now.</p>
        <p>I hope they would integrate some more wallpaper sites and music player support in the near future.</p>
        <p>But if you are looking for a highly productive and customized screen locker then the search is over with
            Next.</p>
        <p>Next is freely available on Playstore. Here’s the link.</p>
